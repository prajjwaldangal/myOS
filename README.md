# ourOS
There may be many embedded operating systems available currently but only a few options when it comes to an open-sourced system with micro-services-based architecture. The compilation of OS images using only the necessary software parts would create a leaner and more efficient software binary. Not only that,  as our devices become more powerful, it is my claim we can trade the computation for ease of troubleshooting. This is especially true in an IoT setting where multiple devices are connected. As a result, functionally separated device clusters would perform better in terms of system availability and uptime.
